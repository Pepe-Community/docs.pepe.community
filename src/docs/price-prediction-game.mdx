description: Predict price and win a prize! 
---

Pepe Price Prediction Game is a game where you can predict the price of an assest, forked and improved from PancakeSwap Prediction Game.

The biggest different is that the Pepe Game is based on the price from PancakeSwap pool, not from Oracle price feed, which reduce the lag time. 

> Predict whether BTC's price will rise or fall – guess correctly to win!

**It's easy to take part:**

- Predict if the price of BTC/BUSD will be higher or lower than it was when the “LIVE” phase starts.

- If you enter an “UP” position, and the BTC/BUSD “Closed Price” is higher than the “Locked Price” at the end of the 15 minute LIVE phase, you WIN! And if it’s lower, you lose.

- If you enter a “DOWN” position, and the BTC/BUSD “Closed Price” is higher than the “Locked Price” at the end of the 15 minute LIVE phase, you LOSE! If it’s lower, you win.

Have fun!
