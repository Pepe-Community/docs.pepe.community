$PEPE is for Pepe only, no whale is allowed.
After deploying, no wallet can accumulate > 0.5% supply and wallets with >=0.25% supply will not be able to earn staking reward.

- On the launching date, in the first hour, the limit transaction size is 0.01% for buying and 0.002% for selling.

- After that:
    - Buy and wallet transfer transactions that trade more than 0.1% of the total supply will be rejected
    - Sell transactions that trade more than 0.02% of the total supply will be rejected. This will protect price movement as well
