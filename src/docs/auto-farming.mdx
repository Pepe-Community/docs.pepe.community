You collect BNB by accessing the dashboard page at https://frogbank.pepe.community

4% of every transaction is taken and re-distributed to all Pepe holders in $BNB, $BTC, $BUSD, $XBN. Thank MoonRat for creating this mechanism,  threshHoldTopUpRate is their innovation.

You will have to wait for a specific duration called cycle (about 1 week) to collect your BNB reward.

In this waiting duration, if you continue to add more than 2% (threshHoldTopUpRate) of your $PEPE balance, the waiting duration will proportionally add up with the cycle.

*(If you sell $PEPE it does not effect your cycle)*

For example, on the first day of your cycle, you add up more 5% $PEPE, you have to wait: 5%*7days = 8,4 hours more. That means you can collect BNB after 7 days and 8,4 hours.

But if the threshHoldTopUpRate >= 100%, the waiting duration will add up max to 7 days.

For example, on the first day of your cycle, you add up more than 100% $PEPE, you have to wait: 7 days more. That means you can collect BNB after 14 days.

This will prevent cheaters who try to add more $PEPE at the end of each cycle.

## Collect BNB Tax

Following the philosophy of building a long-term growing project which benefits everyone.

If you collect more than 1 BNB, 35% of it will be used to buy back $PEPE at the market price and burn them immediately. This feature helps deflate the supply and increase the price of $PEPE for long-term  $PEPE holders.
