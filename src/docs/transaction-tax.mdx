With  $PEPE, each transaction (buy/sell or wallet transfer) has a 11% tax where:

- **4% of every transaction** contributes toward automatically generating further liquidity on Pancake Swap. Benefiting long-term for  $PEPE holders the most!
- **4% of every transaction** is taken and re-distributed to all  $PEPE holders in $BNB & $BTC
- **3% of every transaction** is taken and re-distributed to all  $PEPE holders. The burn address is also a holder thus each transaction helps deflate the supply.
